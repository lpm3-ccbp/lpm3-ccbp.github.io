### **Plushy Project:**\
This assignment required the creation of a circut containing 3 lights, a switch, a button, and a battery pack. This circut connected and sewn into a plsuhy using conductive thread. The plushy was then sewn up with normal thread and stuffed!

**Tips and Tricks**\
I wish I had tested the lights piece by piece when using the conductuve thread that way I knew which specific connection points were causing problems.
