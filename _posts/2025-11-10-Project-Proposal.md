### **Final Project Proposal**
My final project will be making a forget-me-not bag. It will have three pockets, two pockets with flaps and snap pockets to hold my ID and lipgloss/chapstick, and a third with a clip for my key. These pockets will be connected to LEDs with the snap/ "key" homemade button to create breaks in the circuts. When all lights are on (all items accounted for) and the button on the handle of the bag is pressed, the bag will play a fun tune which tells me everything I need is in the purse. The tune changes on ocassion - day or night.\
