### **Seperate Sparklies**
In this assignment we created three different loops that conect to three different LED's on out LilyPad.\ The first is **Flashbulb** which turns on for a half second every four seconds. Next is the **Big Dipper** where the LED turns on every 3 seconds, increasing in brightness every .1 seconds by 30. Finally there is **Synchronous** which flashes for .2 seconds three times seperated by .1 seconds.:\
**Synchronous**


**Tips and Tricks:**\
Doing the math out on paper to visulaize what is happening behind the code, before trying to fix it on the screen.
