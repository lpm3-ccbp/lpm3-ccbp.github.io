### **Forget-Me-Not Bag Project Report!**
**Description:**
When the inside pockets of this bag are filled and all the contents within are accounted for, the corresponding LEDs will turn on. When the button is pressed and both LEDs are on the tune of twinkle twinkle little star will play, indicating that all items are in the bag and it is time to head home.

**Motivation:**
I tend to forget things quite often. I decided that I would create a purse that could alert you when all your belongings are accounted for without searching through your purse. My purses end up with the oddest assortment of objects in them, making it hard to find the important things like keys, chapstick and ID’s. With the Forget-Me-Not Bag, there are two pockets for important items and when the items are inside the bag alerts you with LEDs and a song so that you don’t have to go digging through the abyss.

### **3 Tips to my Past Self:**
1. DOUBLE CHECK that materials make it back to school with you after break\
2. Use a fabric that allows you to see conductive thread traces\
3. Insulate condusctive fabric edges because frayed edges can cause sneaky short circuts/
