### The Basics:
* **Name:** Olivia Mazerolle, I go by Livi
* **Majors:** English and Art History/Studio with a Justice and Law Concentration 
* **Sewing Experience:** I would consider myself a mediocre seamstress. I am the friend who sews buttons back on, hems pants, and takes in the waists thrift finds. I am very comfortable with a needle and thread or a machine! 
* **Programming Experience:** None.
