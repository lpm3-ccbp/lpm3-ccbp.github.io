### Sweater Weather Project!<br>
**Description** <br>
In this program you are able to enter a temperature in the "Temperature" variable and the output will tell you what you should wear according to the temperature!
**Tip for Past Livi** <br>
Give yourself more time so you can test out different combinations.
