title: Why is this English/Art History Major in my Class?
subtitle: Livi Mazerolle...The Computer Scientist?
---
### To round out my time at Williams College, I have decided to enroll in a Computer Science class! As someone who very rarely frequents Science Quad, this course will break up my essays and readings, allowing me to think in a new way. I struggle to enjoy all that technology has to offer simply because I donâ€™t understand it. As a lover of pen on paper, I am hoping to become more comfortable with my computer by the end of this course. 


###### There is also the fact that I needed a Div 3 credit.
